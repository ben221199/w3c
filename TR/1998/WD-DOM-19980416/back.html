<p>Several of the following term definitions have been borrowed or modified
from similar definitions in other W3C documents. Links to these documents
follow the definitions. <dl>
<dt><b><a name='ID-ANCESTOR'>ancestor</a></b></dt>
<dd>An ancestor node of any node A is any node
       above A in a tree model of a document, where "above" means "toward the root."
       </dd><dt><b><a name='ID-18971795'>API</a></b></dt>
<dd>An API is an application programming interface,
       a set of functions or methods used to access some
       functionality.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-967918554'>child</a></b></dt>
<dd>A child is an immediate descendant node of
        a node.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1359195223'>client application</a></b></dt>
<dd>A [client] application is any software that uses the
        Document Object Model programming interfaces provided by the
        hosting implementation to accomplish useful work. Some
        examples of client applications are scripts within an HTML or
        XML document.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-635131714'>content model</a></b></dt>
<dd>The content model is a simple grammar governing
       the allowed types of the child elements and the order in which
       they appear. See [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-xml#sec3.2'>XML</a>
]
       </dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1584078473'>context</a></b></dt>
<dd>A context specifies an access pattern (or
       path): a set of interfaces which give you a way to interact
       with a model. For example, imagine a model with different
       colored arcs connecting data nodes. A context might be a sheet
       of colored acetate that is placed over the model allowing you a
       partial view of the total information in the model.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1417685053'>cooked model</a></b></dt>
<dd>A model for a document that represents the document after it
       has been manipulated in some way. For example, any combination
       of any of the following transformations would create a cooked
       model:
       <ol>
<li>Expansion of internal text entities.</li>
<li>Expansion of external entities.</li>
<li>Model augmentation with style-specified generated
                text.</li>
<li>Execution of style-specified reordering.</li>
<li>Execution of scripts.</li>
</ol>

       A browser might only be able to provide access to a cooked model,
       while an editor might provide access to a cooked or the
       initial structure model (also known as the uncooked
       model) for a document. </dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1251291633'>cursor</a></b></dt>
<dd>A cursor is an object representation of a node. It may
       possess information about context and the path traversed to
       reach the node.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1642568302'>deprecation</a></b></dt>
<dd>When new releases of specifications are released, some older
       features may be marked as being deprecated. This
       means that new work should not use the features and that
       although they are supported in the current release, they may
       not be supported or available in future releases.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-2033844972'>descendant</a></b></dt>
<dd>A descendant node of any node A is any node
       below A in a tree model of a document, where "above" means "toward the root."</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-835308083'>ECMAScript</a></b></dt>
<dd>The programming language defined by the
       <a href='http://www.ecma.ch/stand/ecma-262.htm'>ECMA-262</a>
 standard.  As stated in
       the standard, the originating technology for ECMAScript was
       <a href='http://developer.netscape.com/one/javascript/resources.html'>JavaScript.</a>

       Note that in the ECMAScript binding, the word "property" is
       used in the same sense as the IDL term "attribute."</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1784254842'>element</a></b></dt>
<dd>Each document contains one or more elements, the boundaries of which
       are either delimited by start-tags and end-tags, or, for empty elements
       by an empty-element tag. Each element has a type, identified by name,
       and may have a set of attributes. Each attribute has a name and a value.
       [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-xml#sec-logical-struct'>XML</a>
]
       </dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1617861422'>event propagation, also
        known as event bubbling</a></b></dt>
<dd>This is the idea that an event can affect one object and a set of
       related objects. Any of the potentially affected objects can block the
       event or substitute a different one (upward event propagation). The
       event is broadcast from the node at which it originates to every parent
       node.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-2009138091'>hosting implementation</a></b></dt>
<dd>A [hosting] implementation is a software module that provides an
       implementation of the DOM interfaces so that a client application can
       use them. Some examples of hosting implementations are browsers, editors
       and document repositories.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-810601202'>HTML</a></b></dt>
<dd>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup
       language used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one
       platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic
       semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide
       range of applications. [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32'>HTML
       3.2</a>
] [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40'>HTML4.0</a>
]</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1759547961'>IDL</a></b></dt>
<dd>An Interface Definition Language (IDL) is used
       to define the interfaces for accessing and operating upon
       objects. Examples of IDLs are the
       <a href='http://www.omg.org/'>Object Management Group's IDL</a>
,
       <a href='http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/sdkdoc/mi-laref_49v0.htm'>Microsoft's IDL</a>
, and Sun's
       <a href='http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/preview/docs/ext/idl/'>Java IDL</a>
.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1593154541'>implementor</a></b></dt>
<dd>Companies, organizations, and individuals that claim to support the
       Document Object Model as an API for their products.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1984431211'>initial structure model</a></b></dt>
<dd>Also known as the raw structure model or the
       uncooked model, this represents the document
       before it has been modified by entity expansions, generated
       text, style-specified reordering, or the execution of
       scripts. In some implementations, this might correspond to the
       "initial parse tree" for the document, if it ever
       exists. Note that a given implementation might not be able to
       provide access to the initial structure model for a document,
       though an editor probably would.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-228224232'>language binding</a></b></dt>
<dd>A programming language binding for an IDL
       specification is an implementation of the interfaces in the
       specification for the given language. For example, a Java
       language binding for the Document Object Model IDL
       specification would implement the concrete Java classes that
       provide the functionality exposed by the interfaces.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1177170991'>model</a></b></dt>
<dd>A model is the actual data representation for
       the information at hand. Examples are the structural model and
       the style model representing the parse structure and the style
       information associated with a document. The model might be a
       tree, or a directed graph, or something else.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-PARENT'>parent</a></b></dt>
<dd>A parent is an immediate ancestor node of
        a node.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-2126117750'>root node</a></b></dt>
<dd>The root node is the unique node that is not a
       child of any other node. All other nodes are children or other
       descendents of the root node. [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-xml#sec2.1'>XML</a>
]</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-SIBLING'>sibling</a></b></dt>
<dd>Two nodes are siblings if they have the same parent node.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-369910772'>string comparison</a></b></dt>
<dd>When string matching is required, it is to occur as though the
       comparison was between 2 sequences of code points from the Unicode 2.0
       standard.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1318857531'>tag valid document</a></b></dt>
<dd>A document is tag valid if all begin and end tags are
       properly balanced and nested.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1710134200'>type valid document</a></b></dt>
<dd>A document is type valid if it conforms to an
       explicit DTD.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-511597311'>uncooked model</a></b></dt>
<dd>See initial structure model.</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-902873981'>well-formed document</a></b></dt>
<dd>A document is well-formed if it is tag
       valid and entities are limited to single elements (i.e., single
       sub-trees).</dd><dt><b><a name='ID-1271965095'>XML</a></b></dt>
<dd>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is an
       extremely simple dialect of SGML which is completely described
       in this document. The goal is to enable generic SGML to be
       served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is
       now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for ease of
       implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and
       HTML.
