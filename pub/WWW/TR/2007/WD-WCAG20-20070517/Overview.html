<h2><a id="abstract" name="abstract"> </a>Abstract</h2><p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
        <span>Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of</span> people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning <span>disabilities</span>, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech difficulties, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also make your Web content more accessible to the vast majority of users, including <span>some 
        </span> older users. 
        <span>These guidelines however are not able to address the needs of all people with disabilities.</span>
      </p><p>WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria are provided in separate documents. An <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20">Overview of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Last Call Documents</a> is also available.

        <a href="#WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a>, published as a W3C Recommendation May 1999.</p></div><div>

<h2><a id="intro" name="intro"> </a>Introduction </h2><p>This section is <a title="definition: informative" href="#informativedef" class="termref">informative</a>. </p><p>This is a Working Draft of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0. WCAG is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for Web accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. </p><p>WCAG 2.0 builds upon the work of WCAG 1.0 <a href="#WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a> with provisions that are more testable and that extend to a broader range of technologies including many that are new and evolving.  WCAG 2.0 has been created to be technology independent.  That is, the guidelines and success criteria in WCAG 2.0 can be applied across a wide range of existing and emerging Web technologies. Rather than specifying what technologies to use, WCAG 2.0 lays out general guidelines for using technologies along with specific testable success criteria for guiding and evaluating the use of the technologies. </p><p>
        
        <span>WCAG 2.0 provides</span> requirements for making <a title="definition: content (Web content)" href="#contentdef" class="termref">Web content</a>
        <span>more</span> accessible to a wide range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning <span>disabilities</span>, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech <span>disabilities</span>, and others. <span>Because many people develop vision, hearing, <span>cognitive</span> or motion impairments as they age,</span> following these guidelines will make your Web content more usable by many  older users. 
        <span>However, even content that completely conforms to WCAG may not be fully accessible to every person with a disability. </span>
        
      </p><p>WCAG 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. The guidelines do not include standard usability recommendations except where they have 
        <span>a significantly greater impact on people with disabilities than on other people. 
        </span>
      </p><p>Although some of the accessibility issues of people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities are addressed by WCAG 2.0, either directly or through assistive technologies, the WCAG 2.0 guidelines do not address many areas of need for people with these disabilities. There is a need for more research and development in this important area.
      </p><div class="div2"> <h3><a id="N10223" name="N10223"> </a>Components of Web Accessibility</h3><p>It is important to note that Web content is just one aspect of accessibility.  Just as important as accessible Web content is the availability of accessible browsers (and other user agents) that can adapt and present the content in the best form for the user.  Accessible Web technologies and accessible tools for creating Web content are also important.   For an overview of the different components of accessibility and how they work together see:</p><ul><li><p>

          <span>WCAG 2.0 Supporting Documents</span>
        </h3><p>WCAG 2.0 itself is a technical standard designed primarily for Web developers and designers, authoring tool developers, evaluation tool developers, and others who need a technical standard for Web accessibility. Due to the technical and technology-independent nature of the guidelines and success criteria, and because they say what needs to be done rather than how to do it, it may sometimes be difficult to use the guidelines or success criteria for specific advice for a particular technology (e.g. HTML, XHTML, JavaScript etc).  </p><p>In order to provide more concrete examples as well as specific techniques for meeting each of the success criteria, three support documents or collections have been developed by the working group to accompany the guidelines.

                <a href="/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">WCAG 2.0 Quick Reference</a>
              </strong> -  A concise summary that includes all of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines and success criteria (from above) along with a listing of different techniques that are sufficient to meet every success criterion.  It also optionally lists advisory techniques and provides links to further information on each guideline and success criterion (in Understanding WCAG 2.0).  Web authors may find this the most useful document when trying to make accessible Web sites and it is a good place to start if looking for practical guidance on all of the WCAG 2.0 requirements and specific techniques to meet them.

                <a href="/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a>
              </strong> - A collection of  short (two to four page) "Understanding" documents for each section, guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.0. Each of these short documents focuses on one guideline or success criterion.  It provides the intent of the success criterion, definitions of key words, people who benefit, how to meet the success criteria, links to sufficient techniques and additional advisory techniques and examples.   This collection is equivalent to an applications manual or book on WCAG 2.0.  </p><div class="revnote"><p><strong>Editorial Note</strong>: For this release, the collection is only available as a single long document.

                <a href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques and Failures for WCAG 2.0</a>
              </strong> - A collection of documents each detailing one of the techniques (or known common failures) that have been documented so far.  The techniques collection is continually expanding, with new techniques being added as they are completed. Due to the design of WCAG 2.0, the techniques collection can continue to grow even after the guidelines are released. The "Quick Reference" and "Understanding" documents tie the guidelines to the new techniques as they are created. Each technique document provides an overview of a single technique, notes about user agent (including assistive technology) support, examples (sometimes including code) and a test methodology for sufficient techniques (advisory techniques do not all have tests).  </p><div class="revnote"><p><strong>Editorial Note</strong>: For this release, the Techniques collection is also only available as a single long document.

These four principles lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content that is:</p><ol class="enumar"><li><p>
                <strong>Perceivable</strong> - Information and user interface components must be perceivable by users;</p></li><li><p>
                <strong>Operable</strong> - User interface components must be operable by users;</p></li><li><p>
                <strong>Understandable</strong> - Information and operation of user interface must be understandable by users;</p></li><li><p>
                <strong>Robust</strong> - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p></li></ol></div><div class="div3"><h4><a id="overview-guidelines" name="overview-guidelines"> </a>The Guidelines</h4><p>Under each principle there is a list of guidelines that address the principle. There are a total of 12 guidelines. A convenient list of just the guidelines can be found in the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a>. </p></div><div class="div3"><h4><a id="overview-sc" name="overview-sc"> </a>Success Criteria</h4><p>Under each guideline, there are success criteria that describe specifically what must be achieved in order to <a title="definition: conformance" href="#conformancedef" class="termref">conform</a> to this standard. They are similar to the "checkpoints" in WCAG 1.0. Each success criterion is written as a statement that will be either true or false when specific Web content is tested against it.</p><p>All WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written to be testable. While some can be tested by computer programs, others require human testers for part or all of the test. The same results
should be obtained with a high level of confidence when people who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the Web test the same content. </p><p>Each success criterion for a guideline has a link to the section of the Quick Reference document that provides:</p><ul><li><p>sufficient techniques for meeting the success criterion,</p></li><li><p>optional advisory techniques, and</p></li><li><p>links to descriptions of the intent of the success criteria, including benefits, and examples.</p></li></ul></div><div class="div3"><h4><a id="overview-levels" name="overview-levels"> </a>Three levels of conformance </h4><p>WCAG 2.0 success criteria are organized into three levels of conformance.</p><ul><li><p>
                <strong>"A" (single-A) conformance:</strong> all Level A success criteria must be satisfied in order to achieve A (single-A) conformance.</p></li><li><p>
                <strong>"AA" (double-A) conformance:</strong> all Level A and Level AA success criteria must be satisfied in order to achieve AA (double-A) conformance.</p></li><li><p>
                <strong>"AAA" (triple-A) conformance:</strong> all Level A, AA, and AAA must be satisfied in order to achieve AAA (triple-A) conformance. </p></li></ul><p>The word "levels" does not mean that some success criteria are more important than others. Each success criterion in WCAG 2.0 is essential to some users, and the levels build upon each other. <span>However, even content that conforms at AAA (triple-A) may not be fully accessible to every person with a disability or combination of disabilities, especially certain types of severe disabilities.
              
            </span>
          </p><ul><li><p>In general, Level A success criteria achieve accessibility by supporting assistive technology while putting the fewest possible limits on presentation. Thus people with a wide range of disabilities using a wide range of assistive technologies, from voice input and eye-tracking devices to screen readers and screen magnifiers, are able to access content in different ways. In other words, Level A success criteria support the ability of both mainstream and specialized user agents to adapt content to formats that meet their users' needs.</p></li><li><p>The success criteria in Level AA provide additional support for assistive technology. At the same time, they also support direct access to content by the many people who use conventional user agents without assistive technology. In general, Level AA success criteria place more limits on visual presentation and other aspects of content than the success criteria in Level A.</p></li><li><p>Level AAA success criteria increase both direct access and access through assistive technology. They place tighter limits on both presentation and content, which means that some types of content may not be able to satisfy this level of conformance.</p></li></ul><p>It is recommended that even if content does not conform at a specific level, that it conform to the extent possible. </p></div></div><div class="div2"> <h3><a id="new-terms" name="new-terms"> </a>Important New Terms Used in WCAG 2.0</h3><p>WCAG 2.0 includes several important new terms. <span>In some cases, these terms are just clarifications of concepts that have been in use but have not been clearly defined in the past.  In other cases, they are terms that match new concepts that have been developed to cope with the new technologies that are continually emerging and with the accessibility issues and strategies that are emerging to address them.</span>
          
        </p><dl><dt class="label">Sufficient Techniques</dt><dd><p>For each success criterion, there is a list of techniques deemed by the Working Group to be sufficient to meet the requirement. For each sufficient technique, there is a test to determine whether the technique has been successfully implemented. If the test(s) for a "sufficient" technique (or combination of techniques) are passed, then that success criterion has been <span>satisfied</span>. </p><p>Passing all tests for all sufficient techniques is not necessary. Most success criteria have multiple "sufficient techniques" listed.  Any of the listed "sufficient techniques" can be used to meet the success criterion. </p><p>Note that it is not necessary to meet a success criterion using one of the sufficient techniques that have been documented by the WCAG working group. There may be other techniques which are not documented by the working group that would also meet the success criterion. The working group went through the effort to document these "sufficient techniques" in order to make it easy for authors to identify techniques that meet each success criterion and to have confidence (and evidence) that the techniques meet the success criterion.  When using other externally-provided techniques to meet WCAG 2.0 requirements, it is important that they be created by individuals or organizations who are knowledgeable about the requirements of WCAG 2.0 and the needs of people with disabilities.  The working group will continue to add new "sufficient techniques" as they are identified, developed, or made effective by advances in user agents including assistive technologies.</p></dd><dt class="label">Advisory Techniques</dt><dd><p>In addition to the sufficient techniques, there are a number of techniques that may enhance accessibility that did not qualify as sufficient techniques because they are not testable, are not sufficient to meet the full requirements of the success criteria, and/or are good and effective techniques in some circumstances but not effective (and therefore sufficient) in others.   These are listed as "Advisory Techniques."  Authors are encouraged to use these techniques where appropriate. Although using them does not affect conformance, it can enhance accessibility for some users. Many of the advisory techniques are particularly helpful for people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, and use of these techniques will improve the accessibility of the content to people with these disabilities.</p></dd><dt class="label">Web Page</dt><dd><p>While not an entirely new term, it is important to note that, in this standard, the term "Web page" includes much more than static HTML pages.  It also includes the increasingly dynamic Web pages that are emerging on the Web, including "pages" that can present entire virtual interactive communities.  Technically a Web page, as defined in the glossary, is "a resource that is referenced by a URI and is not embedded in another resource, plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it."  What this means is that a Web page is whatever you find at the end of a Web address that you visit.  It includes Web applications, Webcasts, multimedia objects and other types of interactive content to which the word "page" may not typically apply. It is in this evolved sense of the concept that the term is used in WCAG 2.0. </p><p>For example, the term "Web page" would include a movie-like interactive shopping environment where the user visually moves about a store dragging products off of the shelves around them into a visual shopping cart in front of them where clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet alongside.</p></dd><dt class="label">Programmatically Determined</dt><dd><p>Several success criteria require that content (or certain aspects of content) can be "programmatically determined." This means that the content is delivered in such a way that user agents, including assistive technologies, can access the information.  A critical element in having anything be "programmatically determined" is that assistive technologies are able to retrieve and use the information.  This lets <a title="definition: user agent" href="#useragentdef" class="termref">user agents</a> and <a title="definition: Assistive technology (as used in this document 732&#10;            )" href="#atdef" class="termref">assistive technologies</a> transform the content and present it to the user in different sensory modalities (e.g. vision, hearing) or styles of presentation. If assistive technologies cannot do this, then the information can not be said to be programmatically determined.  </p><p>The term was created in order to allow the working group to clearly identify those places where information had to be accessible to assistive technologies (and other user agents acting as accessibility aids) without specifying exactly how this needed to be done.  This is important because of the continually changing nature of the technologies.   It is important neither to declare things as accessible because they might be in the future (when they aren't now) nor to declare things as inaccessible in a permanent way when they may very well become accessible in the future.  </p><p>The use of the term allows the guidelines to identify what needs to be "programmatically determined"  in order to meet the guidelines, and then have separate, updateable documents (the Quick Reference, Understanding, and  Technique documents) list those techniques and technologies that meet the requirements over time. </p></dd><dt class="label">Accessibility Supported</dt><dd><p>In order for content created with Web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, PDF, GIF, MPEG, Flash etc.) to be accessible to people with different types of disabilities, it is essential that the technologies work with assistive technologies and the accessibility features of browsers and other user agents.  In order for something to meet a success criterion that requires it to be  "programmatically determined" for example, it would need to be implemented using a technology that has assistive technology support.  </p><p>
                <strong>"Accessibility supported" means supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents. </strong>
              </p><p>Authors who don't know which technologies <span>or which aspects and features of a technology</span> have support from assistive technologies should  consult documented lists of technologies that are known to have accessibility support.  Such lists can make it easier than it is today for an author to identify technologies or features of different technologies that are supported by assistive technologies and can be used to meet the success criteria that require assistive technology support (i.e. require that content can be programmatically determined.) </p><div class="revnote"><p><strong>Editorial Note</strong>: The W3C WAI will be compiling existing information on its technologies.  It is expected that other organizations will compile such information for their technologies.  There will undoubtedly be others who create documented lists as well.</p></div><div class="revnote"><p><strong>Editorial Note</strong>:  The Baseline concept has been replaced by the "accessibility support" of Web technologies and "Documented lists of Web technologies that have accessibility support."  </p></div><div class="note"><p class="prefix">Note:  The requirements for "accessibility support" of Web technologies are provided in the conformance section of these guidelines (See also <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a>.)</p></div><p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20070517/Overview.html#uc-accessibility-support-head">Understanding accessibility support</a> in Understanding WCAG 2.0. </p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="body"><div class="div1">
