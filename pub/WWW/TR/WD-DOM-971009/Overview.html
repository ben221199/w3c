    <H2>Abstract</H2>
    
    <P>This specification defines the Document Object Model, a platform- and
      language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to
      dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of
      documents. The Document Object Model provides a standard model of how the
      objects in an XML or HTML document are put together and a standard
      interface for accessing and manipulating these objects and their
      inter-relationships. Vendors can support the DOM as an interface to their
      proprietary data structures and APIs, and content authors can write to the
      standard DOM interfaces rather than product-specific APIs, thus increasing
      interoperability on the Web.</P>
    
    <H2>Status of this document</H2>
    
    <P>This is a W3C Working Draft for review by W3C members and other
      interested parties. It is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or
      obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use W3C
      Working Drafts as reference material or to cite them as other than &quot;work
      in progress&quot;. This is work in progress and does not imply endorsement
      by, or the consensus of, either W3C or members of the DOM working group.
    </P>
    
    <P>This document has been produced as part of the
      <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/DOM/Activity.html">W3C DOM Activity</A>, and
      is intended as a draft of a proposed recommendation for the Document
      Object Model. The authors of this document are the DOM WG members.
      Different chapters of the Document Object Model may have different
      editors. </P>
    
    <P>The goal of the DOM group is to define a programmatic interface for XML
      and HTML. The Core DOM therefore provides a low-level set of objects that
      can represent any structured document. While by itself this interface is
      capable of representing any HTML or XML document, the core interface is a
      compact and minimal design for manipulating the document's contents.
      Depending upon the DOM's usage, the core DOM interface may not be
      convenient or appropriate for all users. Additional, higher-level
      interfaces are being designed on top of the core specification that
      provide a more convenient view into the document. This consists of objects
      and methods that provide easier and more direct access into specific types
      of documents. </P>
    
    <P>These higher-level interfaces for HTML and XML are still being discussed
      within the working group. For the HTML application of the DOM, the HTML
      Object Model will build on the functionality currently exposed by Netscape
      Navigator 3.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 (level 0) to provide an
      interface for manipulating HTML documents, including their structure and
      content. Consistency will be maintained with the existing paradigms for
      exposing elements in the HTML document (e.g., forms collection) as far as
      is possible, while still allowing us to define a specification that will
      be flexible and extensible enough for the future work. </P>
    
    <P>We will update this draft specification on a regular basis.</P>

    <H2>Structure of This Document</H2>
    
    <P>The DOM specification is structured as a book. The various parts of the
      specification are available as separate chapters of the book.</P>
