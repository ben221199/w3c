<h3><a name=changes>Recent Changes</a></h3>

<p>This specification extends HTML to support tables. The table model
has grown out of early work on HTML+ and the initial draft of <a
href="#html3">HTML3</a>. The earlier model has been been extended in
response to requests from information providers for improved control
over the presentation of tabular information:

<ul>
    <li>alignment on designated characters such as "." and ":"<br>
        e.g. aligning a column of numbers on the decimal point

    <li>more flexibility in specifying table frames and rules

    <li>incremental display for large tables as data is received

    <li>the ability to support scrollable tables with fixed headers
        plus<br>better support for breaking tables across pages for printing

    <li>optional column based defaults for alignment properties
</ul>

<p>In addition, a major goal has been to provide FULL backwards compatibility
with the widely deployed Netscape implementation of tables. A subsidiary goal
has been to simplify importing tables conforming to the SGML CALS model.

<h2><a name=introduction>A Brief Introduction to HTML Tables</a></h2>

<P>Tables start with an optional caption followed by one or more rows.
Each row is formed by one or more cells, which are differentiated into
header and data cells. Cells can be merged across rows and columns, and
include attributes assisting rendering to speech and braille, or for
exporting table data into databases. The model provides limited
support for control over appearence, for example horizontal and vertical
alignment of cell contents, border styles and cell margins. You can further
affect this by grouping rows and columns together. Tables can contain
a wide range of content, such as headers, lists, paragraphs, forms, figures,
preformatted text and even nested tables.

<h3>Example</h3>

<PRE>&lt;TABLE BORDER&gt;
  &lt;CAPTION&gt;A test table with merged cells&lt;/CAPTION&gt;
  &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH ROWSPAN=2&gt;&lt;TH COLSPAN=2&gt;Average
      &lt;TH ROWSPAN=2&gt;other&lt;BR&gt;category&lt;TH&gt;Misc
  &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;height&lt;TH&gt;weight
  &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH ALIGN=LEFT&gt;males&lt;TD&gt;1.9&lt;TD&gt;0.003
  &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH ALIGN=LEFT ROWSPAN=2&gt;females&lt;TD&gt;1.7&lt;TD&gt;0.002
&lt;/TABLE&gt;</PRE>

<P>On a dumb terminal, this would be rendered something like:

<pre>              A test table with merged cells
    /--------------------------------------------------\
    |          |      Average      |  other   |  Misc  |
    |          |-------------------| category |--------|
    |          |  height |  weight |          |        |
    |-----------------------------------------|--------|
    | males    | 1.9     | 0.003   |          |        |
    |-----------------------------------------|--------|
    | females  | 1.7     | 0.002   |          |        |
    \--------------------------------------------------/
</pre>

<p>Next, a richer example with grouped rows and columns (adapted from "Developing
International Software" by Nadine Kano). First here is what the table looks
like on paper:

<h2><a name=rationale>Design Rationale</a></h2>

<p>The HTML table model has evolved from studies of existing SGML
tables models, the treatment of tables in common word processing
packages, and looking at a wide range of tabular layout in magazines,
books and other paper-based documents. The model was chosen to allow
simple tables to be expressed simply with extra complexity only when
needed. This makes it practical to create the markup for HTML tables
with everyday text editors and reduces the learning curve for getting
started. This feature has been very important to the success of HTML
to date.

<p>Increasingly people are using filters from other document formats or
direct wysiwyg editors for HTML. It is important that the HTML table
model fits well with these routes for authoring HTML. This affects how
the representation handles cells which span multiple rows or columns,
and how alignment and other presentation properties are associated with
groups of cells.

<p>A major consideration for the HTML table model is that the fonts and
window sizes etc. in use with browsers are not under the author's
control. This makes it risky to rely on column widths specified
in terms of absolute units such as picas or pixels. Instead, tables can be
dynamically sized to match the current window size and fonts. Authors
can provide guidance as to the relative widths of columns, but user
agents should to ensure that columns are wide enough to avoid
clipping cell contents.

<p>For large tables or slow network connections, it is desirable to be able
to start displaying the table before all of the data has been received.
The default window width for most user agents shows about 80 characters,
and the graphics for many HTML pages are designed with these defaults in
mind. Authors can provide a hint to user agents to activate incremental
display of table contents. This feature requires the author to specify the
number of columns, and includes provision for control of table width and the
relative widths of different columns.

<p>For incremental display, the browser needs the number of columns and
their widths. The default width of the table is the current window size
(<tt>width="100%"</tt>). This can be altered by including a <tt>WIDTH</tt>
attribute in the <tt>TABLE</tt> start tag. By default all columns have the
same width, but you can specify column widths with one or more
<tt>COL</tt> elements before the table data starts.

<p>The remaining issue is the number of columns. Some people have suggested
waiting until the first row of the table has been received, but this could
take a long time if the cells have a lot of content. On the whole it makes
more sense, when incremental display is desired, to get authors to
explicitly specify the number of columns in the <tt>TABLE</tt> start tag.

<p>Authors still need a way of informing the browser whether to use
incremental display or to automatically size the table to match the cell
contents. For the two pass auto sizing mode, the number of columns is
determined by the first pass, while for the incremental mode, the number of
columns needs to be stated up front. So it seems to that the
<tt>COLS=<i>nn</i></tt> would be better for this purpose, than a
<tt>LAYOUT</tt> attribute such as <tt>LAYOUT=FIXED</tt> or
<tt>LAYOUT=AUTO</tt>.

<p>It is generally held useful to consider documents from two perspectives:
Structural idioms such as headers, paragraphs, lists, tables, and figures;
and rendering idioms such as margins, leading, font names and sizes.
The wisdom of past experience encourages us to separate the structural
information of documents from rendering information. Mixing them together
ends up causing increased cost of ownership for maintaining documents,
and reduced portability between applications and media.

<p>For tables, the alignment of text within table cells, and the borders
between cells are, from the purist's point of view, rendering information.
In practice, though, it is useful to group these with the structural
information, as these features are highly portable from one application to
the next. The HTML table model leaves most rendering information to
associated style sheets. The model is designed to take advantage of such
style sheets but not to require them.

<p>This specification provides a superset of the simpler model presented
in earlier work on HTML+. Tables are considered as being formed from an
optional caption together with a sequence of rows, which in turn consist of
a sequence of table cells. The model further differentiates header and data
cells, and allows cells to span multiple rows and columns.

<p>Following the <a href="#cals">CALS table model</a>, this specification
allows table rows to be grouped into head and body sections. This simplifies
the representation of rendering information and can be used to repeat
table head and foot rows when breaking tables across page boundaries,
or to provide fixed headers above a scrollable body panel.

<p>For the visually impaired, HTML offers the hope of setting to
rights the damage caused by the adoption of windows based graphical
user interfaces. The HTML table model includes attributes for labeling
each cell, to support high quality text to speech conversion. The same
attributes can also be used to support automated import and export of
table data to databases or spreadsheets.

<p>This specification allows authors to define groups of columns
along with column based alignment properties. A simple inheritance
mechanism defines the precedence order for determining applicable
values for alignment for each cell.

<p>Current desktop publishing packages provide very rich control over the
rendering of tables, and it would be impractical to reproduce this in
HTML, without making HTML into a bulky rich text format like RTF or MIF.
This specification does, however, offer authors the ability to choose from
a set of commonly used classes of border styles. The BORDER attribute
controls the appearence of the border frame around the table while the
RULES attribute determines the choice of rulings within the table. A finer
level of control will be possible via style sheets.

<hr>
<h2><a name=walkthru>A walk through the table DTD</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="#dtd">table document type definition</a> provides the formal
definition of the allowed syntax for html tables. The following is an
annotated listing of the DTD. The complete listing appears at the end of
this document.

<p>Note that the <tt>TABLE</tt> element is a block-like element
rather a character-level element. As such it is a peer of other HTML
block-like elements such as paragraphs, lists and headers.

<h2><a name="id-lang-class">Common Attributes</a></h2>

<p>The following attributes occur in several of the elements and are
defined here for brevity. In general, all attribute names and values
in this specification are case insensitive, except where noted
otherwise.

<pre>
&lt;!ENTITY % attrs
       "id      ID       #IMPLIED  -- element identifier --
        class   NAMES    #IMPLIED  -- used with style sheets --
        lang    NAME     #IMPLIED  -- as per RFC 1766 --"&gt;
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><B>ID</B>
<dd>Used to define a document-wide identifier. This can be used for
naming positions within documents as the destination of a hypertext
link. It may also be used by style sheets for rendering an element in a
unique style.

<dt><B>CLASS</B>
<dd>A space separated list of SGML NAME tokens. NAME tokens are
formed by an initial letter followed by letters, digits, "-" and "."
characters. CLASS names specify that the element belongs to the
corresponding named classes. These may be used by style sheets to
provide class dependent renderings.

<dt><B>LANG</B>
<dd>A LANG attribute identifies the natural language used by the
content of the associated element.The syntax and registry of language
values are defined by <a href="#rfc1766">RFC 1766.</a> In summary the
language is given as a primary tag followed by zero or more subtags,
separated by "-". White space is not allowed and all tags are case
insensitive. The name space of tags is administered by IANA. The two
letter primary tag is an ISO 639 language abbreviation, while the initial
subtag is a two letter ISO 3166 country code. Example values for LANG
include:

</dl>

<pre>     en, en-US, en-uk, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin.</pre>

<hr>
<h2><a name="alignment">Horizontal and Vertical Alignment Attributes</a></h2>

<p>The alignment of cell contents can be specified on a cell by cell basis,
or inherited from enclosing elements, such as the row, column or the table
element itself.

<dl>
<dt><B>ALIGN</B>
<dd>This specifies the horizontal alignment of cell contents.

<pre>&lt;!-- horizontal alignment attributes for cell contents --&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % cell.halign
        "align  (left|center|right|justify|char) #IMPLIED
         char    CDATA   #IMPLIED -- alignment char, e.g. char=':' --
         charoff NUTOKEN 50       -- % offset for alignment char --"
        &gt;</pre>

<p>The attribute value should be one of LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, JUSTIFY and CHAR.
User agents may treat JUSTIFY as left alignment if they lack support for text
justification. ALIGN=CHAR is used for aligning cell contents on a particular
character.

<p>For cells spanning multiple rows or columns, where the alignment
property is inherited from the row or column, the initial row and column for
the cell determines the appropriate alignment property to use.

<p>Note that an alignment attribute on elements within the cell, e.g. on a
P element, overrides the normal alignment value for the cell.

<dt><B>CHAR</B>
<dd>This is used to specify an alignment character for use with align=char,
e.g. <tt>char=":"</tt>. The default character is the decimal point for the
current language, as set by the LANG attribute. The CHAR attribute value is
case sensitive.

<dt><b>CHAROFF</b>
<dd>An integer value that defines the offset to the alignment character as a
percentage of the cell width, e.g. <tt>charoff=70</tt>. The default value is
<tt>charoff=50</tt>, i.e. midway through the cell.

<p>Only the first occurence of the alignment character is significant
for alignment purposes. If a line doesn't include the alignment character,
it should be horizontally shifted to end at the alignment position.

<p>Note that this applies whether the text is displayed left to right,
or right to left. If several cells in different rows for the same column use
character alignment, then all such cells should line up, regardless of which
character is used for alignment.

<dt><b>VALIGN</b>
<dd>Defines whether the cell contents are aligned with the top, middle or
bottom of the cell.


<pre>&lt;!-- vertical alignment attributes for cell contents --&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % cell.valign
        "valign  (top|middle|bottom)  #IMPLIED"
        &gt;</pre>

<p>If present, the value of the attribute should be one of: TOP, MIDDLE,
BOTTOM or BASELINE. All cells in the same row with valign=baseline should be
vertically positioned so that the first text line in each such cell occur on
a common baseline. This constraint does not apply to subsequent text lines in
these cells.
</dl>

<h3><a name=order>Inheritance Order</a></h3>

<p>Alignment properties can be included with most of the table elements:
COL, THEAD, TBODY, TR, TH and TD. When rendering cells, horizontal
alignment is determined by columns in preference to rows, while for
vertical alignment, the rows are more important than the columns. The
following table gives the detailed precedence order for each attribute:

<pre>
    ALIGN       (TH|TD) < COL < TR < (THEAD|TBODY) <  default
    VALIGN      (TH|TD) < TR < (THEAD|TBODY) < COL <  default
    LANG        (TH|TD) < TR < (THEAD|TBODY) < COL < TABLE < default
</pre>

<p>Properties defined on cells take precedence over inherited properties,
but are in turn over-ridden by alignment properties on elements within cells.
In the absence of an ALIGN attribute along the inheritance path, the
recommended default alignment for table cell contents is ALIGN=LEFT for table
data and ALIGN=CENTER for table headers. The recommended default for vertical
alignment is VALIGN=MIDDLE.

<hr>

<h2><a name=units>Standard Units for Widths</a></h2>

<p>Several attributes specify widths as a number followed by an optional
suffix. The units for widths are specified by the suffix: <b>pt</b>
denotes points, <b>pi</b> denotes picas, <b>in</b> denotes inches,
<b>cm</b> denotes centimeters, <b>mm</b> denotes millimeters, <b>em</b> denotes
em units (equal to the height of the default font), and <b>px</b> denotes screen
pixels. The default units are screen pixels. The number is an integer
value or a real valued number such as "2.5". Exponents, as in "1.2e2", are
not allowed. White space is not allowed between the number and the suffix.

<hr>
<h2>The TABLE element</h2>

<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT table - - (caption?, col*, thead?, tbody+)&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST table                    -- table element --
        %attrs;                    -- id, lang, class --
        float (left|right) #IMPLIED -- relative to window --
        width   CDATA    #IMPLIED  -- table width relative to window --
        cols    NUMBER   #IMPLIED  -- used for immediate display mode --
        border  CDATA    #IMPLIED  -- controls frame width around table --
        frame   %Frame;  #IMPLIED  -- which parts of table frame to include --
        rules   %Rules;  #IMPLIED  -- controls rules between cells --
        cellspacing NUMBER #IMPLIED -- spacing between cells --
        cellpadding NUMBER #IMPLIED -- spacing within cells --
        &gt;</pre>

<p>The TABLE element requires both start and end tags. Table elements start
with an optional CAPTION element, optionally followed by one or more COL
elements, then an optional THEAD, and finally one or more TBODY elements.

<hr>
<dl>
<dt><b>ID, LANG</b> and <b>CLASS</b>
<dd>See earlier description of <a href="#id-lang-class">common attributes</a>.

<dt><B>FLOAT</B>
<dd>Defines whether the table is part of the main text flow or, whether it
floats to the left (FLOAT=LEFT) or right (FLOAT=RIGHT), with the main text
flow continuing around it. The default is deliberately unspecified.
<I>The attribute is named FLOAT to distinguish it from the ALIGN
attribute, which is used for setting the default horizontal alignment
of cell contents.</I>

<dt><B>WIDTH</B>
<dd>Specifies the desired width of the table. In addition to the <a
href="#units">standard units</a>, the "%" sign may used to indicate that the
width specifies the percentage width of the space between the current left
and right margins, e.g. <tt>width="50%"</tt>.

<p>It is recommended that the table width be increased beyond the value
indicated by the WIDTH attribute as needed to avoid clipping of cell contents.
In the absence of this attribute, the table width can be determined
by the <a href="#layout">layout algorithm</a> given later on.

<dt><b>COLS</b>
<dd>Specifies the number of columns for the table. If present the user
agent may render the table dynamically as data is received from the
network without waiting for the complete table to be received. If the
WIDTH attribute is missing, a default of "100%" may be assumed for this
purpose. If the COLS attribute is absent, a prepass through the table's
contents is needed to determine the number of columns together with
suitable values for the widths of each column.

<dt><B>BORDER</B>
<dd>Specifies the width of the border framing the the table, see
<a href="#units">standard units</a>.

<dt><B>FRAME</B>
<dd>Specifies which sides of the frame to render.

<pre>&lt;!ENTITY % Frame "(none|top|bottom|topbot|sides|all|border)"&gt;</pre>

        %cell.valign;              -- vertical alignment in cells --
        &gt;
</pre>

<p>This optional element is used to specify column based defaults for
table properties. It is an empty element, and as such has no content, and
shouldn't be given an end tag. Several COL elements may be given in
succession.

<dl>
<dt><b>ID, LANG</b> and <b>CLASS</b>
<dd>See earlier description of <a href="#id-lang-class">common

<dt><b>SPAN</b>
<dd>A positive integer value that specifies how many columns this element
applies to, defaulting to one. In the absence of SPAN attributes the first
COL element applies to the first column, the second COL element to the second
column and so on. If the second COL element had span=2, it would apply
to the second and third column. The next COL element would then apply to
the fourth column and so on. SPAN=0 has a special significance and implies
that the COL element spans all columns from the current column upto and
including the last column.

<dt><b>WIDTH</b>
<dd>Specifies the width of the columns, see <a href="#units">standard units</a>.
In addition, the "*" suffix denotes relative widths, e.g.

<pre>
     width=64        width in screen pixels
     width=0.5*      a relative width of 0.5
</pre>

<p>Relative widths act as constraints on the relative widths of different
columns. When widths are given in absolute units, the user agent can use
these to constrain the width of the table.

<p><i>Percentage widths are inappropriate as you would need to check that
the numbers add up, and they would all have to be changed if a column
was inserted or removed. The "*" suffix is used to simplify importing
tables from the CALS representation.</i>

        %cell.valign;              -- vertical alignment in cells --
        &gt;
</pre>

<p>Tables may be divided up into head and body sections. The THEAD
element is optional, but one or more TBODY elements are always
required. If the table only consists of a TBODY section, the TBODY
start and end tags may be omitted, as the parser can infer them. If a
THEAD element is present, the THEAD start tag is required, but the end
tag can be omitted, provided a TBODY start tag follows. <i>This definition
provides compatibility with tables created for the older model, as well as
allowing the end tags for THEAD, and TBODY to be omitted.</i>

<p>The THEAD and TBODY elements provide a convenient means for controlling
rendering. If the table has a large number of rows in the body, user
agents may choose to use a scrolling region for the table body. When
rendering to a paged device, tables will often have to be broken across
page boundaries. The THEAD and TBODY elements allow the user agent to
repeat the table head at the top of the new page before continuing on with
the table body.

<p>Each THEAD and TBODY element must contain one or more <a href="#rows">TR

<p>TH elements are used to represent header cells, while TD elements are
used to represent data cells. This allows user agents to render header and
data cells distinctly, even in the absence of style sheets.

<p>Cells can span multiple rows and columns, and may be empty. Cells
spanning rows contribute to the column count on each of the
spanned rows, but only appear in the markup once (in the first row
spanned). The row count is determined by the number of TR elements. Any
rows implied by cells spanning rows beyond this should be ignored.

<p>If the column count for the table is greater than the number of cells
for a given row (after including cells for spanned rows), the missing cells
are treated as occurring on the right hand side of the table and rendered as
empty cells. If the language context indicates a right to left writing order,
then the missing cells should be placed on the left hand side.

<p>It is possible to create tables with overlapping cells, for instance:

<pre>
    &lt;table border&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=2&gt;1&lt;td&gt;2&lt;td&gt;3
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td rowspan=2&gt;4
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;5&lt;td&gt;6
    &lt;/table&gt;
</pre>

<p>which might look something like:
    
<pre>    /-----------\
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 
    |   |-------|
    |   | 4 |   |
    |---|...|---|
    | 5 :   | 6 |
    \-----------/</pre>

<p>In this example, the cells labelled 4 and 5 overlap. In such cases, the
rendering is implementation dependent.

<P>The AXIS and AXES attributes for cells provide a means for defining
concise labels for cells. When rendering to speech, these attributes may
be used  to provide abbreviated names for the headers relevant to each
cell. Another application is when you want to be able to later process
table contents to enter them into a database. These attributes are then
used to give database field names. The table's class attribute should be
used to let the software recognize which tables can be treated in this
way.

<dl>
<dt><b>ID, LANG</b> and <b>CLASS</b>
<dd>See earlier description of <a href="#id-lang-class">common

<dt><b>AXIS</b>
<dd>This defines an abbreviated name for a header cell, e.g. which can be used

<dt><b>AXES</b>
<dd>This is a comma separated list of axis names which together identify
the row and column headers that pertain to this cell. It is used for
example when rendering to speech to identify the cell's position in the

<h2><a name=layout>Recommended Layout Algorithms</a></h2>

<p>If the COLS attribute on the TABLE element specifies the number of columns,
then the table may be rendered using a fixed layout, otherwise the autolayout
algorithm described below should be used.

<h3>Fixed Layout Algorithm</h3>

<p>For this algorithm, it is assumed that the number of columns is known.
The column widths by default should be set to the same size. Authors may
override this by specifying relative or absolute column widths, using the
COL element. The default table width is the space between the current left
and right margins, but may be overridden by the WIDTH attribute on the TABLE
element, or determined from absolute column widths.

<p>The table syntax alone is insufficient to guarantee the consistency of
attribute values. For instance, the number of columns specified by the
COLS attribute may be inconsistent with the number of columns implied by
the COL elements. This in turn, may be inconsistent with the number of
columns implied by the table cells. A further problem occurs when the
columns are too narrow to avoid clipping cell contents. The width of the
table as specified by the TABLE element or COL elements may result in
clipping of cell contents. It is recommended that user agents attempt to
recover gracefully from these situations.

<h3>Autolayout Algorithm</h3>

<p>If the COLS attribute is missing from the table start tag, then the user
agent should use the following autolayout algorithm. It uses two passes
through the table data and scales linearly with the size of the table.

<p>In the first pass, line wrapping is disabled, and the user agent
keeps track of the minimum and maximum width of each cell. The maximum
width is given by the widest line. As line wrap has been disabled,
paragraphs are treated as long lines unless broken by &lt;BR&gt;
elements. The minimum width is given by the widest word or image etc.
taking into account leading indents and list bullets etc. In other
words, if you were to format the cell's content in a window of its own,
determine the minimum width you could make the window before things
begin to be clipped.

<P>To cope with character alignment of cell contents, the algorithm
keeps three running min/max totals for each column: Left of align char,
right of align char and un-aligned. The minimum width for a column is then:
<tt>max(min_left + min_right, min_non-aligned)</tt>.

<P>The minimum and maximum cell widths are then used to determine the
corresponding minimum and maximum widths for the columns. These in turn,
are used to find the minimum and maximum width for the table. Note that
cells can contain nested tables, but this doesn't complicate the code
significantly. The next step is to assign column widths according to the
current window size (more accurately - the width between the left and
right margins).

<P>For cells which span multiple columns, a simple approach, as used by
<a href="#arena">Arena</a>, is to evenly apportion the min/max widths to each
of the constituent columns. A slightly more complex approach is to use the
min/max widths of unspanned cells to weight how spanned widths are
apportioned. Experimental study suggests a blend of the two approaches will
give good results for a wide range of tables.

<P>The table borders and intercell margins need to be included in assigning
column widths. There are three cases:

<OL>
<LI><B>The minimum table width is equal to or wider than the available
space.</B> In this case, assign the minimum widths and allow the user to
scroll horizontally. For conversion to braille, it will be necessary to
replace the cells by references to notes containing their full content.
By convention these appear before the table.

<LI><B>The maximum table width fits within the available space.</B> In
this case, set the columns to their maximum widths.

<LI><B>The maximum width of the table is greater than the available
space, but the minimum table width is smaller.</B> In this case, find
the difference between the available space and the minimum table width,
lets call it <b>W</b>. Lets also call <b>D</b> the difference between
maximum and minimum width of the table.

<P>For each column, let <b>d</b> be the the difference between maximum
and minimum width of that column. Now set the column's width to the
minimum width plus <b>d</b> times <b>W</b> over <b>D</b>. This makes
columns with lots of text wider than columns with smaller amounts.
</OL>

<P>This assignment step is then repeated for nested tables. In this case,
the width of the enclosing table's cell plays the role of the current
window size in the above description. This process is repeated
recursively for all nested tables.

<P>If the table width is specified with the WIDTH attribute, the user
agent attempts to set column widths to match. The WIDTH attribute is
not binding if this results in columns having less than their minimum
widths.

<P>If relative widths are specified with the COL element, the algorithm
is modified to increase column widths over the minimum width to meet the
relative width constraints. The COL elements should be taken as hints only,
so columns shouldn't be set to less than their minimum width. Similarly,
columns shouldn't be made so wide that the table stretches well beyond the
extent of the window. If a COL element specifies a relative width of zero,
the column should always be set to its minimum width.

<h2><a name=dtd>HTML Table DTD</a></h2>

<p>The DTD or document type definition provides the formal definition
of the allowed syntax for html tables.

<pre>&lt;!-- The HTML Table DTD --&gt;

&lt;!-- Content model entities imported from parent DTD:

  %body.content; allows table cells to contain headers, paras,
  lists, form elements and even arbitrarily nested tables.

  %text; is text characters, including character entities and
  character emphasis elements, IMG and anchors
--&gt;

&lt;!ENTITY % attrs
       "id      ID       #IMPLIED  -- element identifier --
        class   NAMES    #IMPLIED  -- used with style sheets --

&lt;!--
 The BORDER attribute sets the thickness of the frame around the
 table. The default units are screen pixels.

 The FRAME attribute specifies which parts of the frame around
 the table should be rendered.

        none    no frame
        top     render only the top part of the frame
        bottom  render only the bottom part of the frame
        topbot  render both top and bottom parts
        sides   render both left and right parts
        all     render all four parts
        border  render all four parts

 The value "border" is chosen for backwards compatibility with
 &lt;TABLE BORDER&gt; which yields frame=border and border=implied
 For &lt;TABLE BORDER=1&gt; you get border=1 and frame=implied. In this
 case, its appropriate to treat this as frame=border for backwards
 compatibility with deployed browsers.

 The RULES attribute defines which rules to draw between cells:

        none    no rules between cells
        basic   rule between thead/tbody and tbody/tbody
        rows    as per basic plus row separators
        cols    as per basic plus column group separators
